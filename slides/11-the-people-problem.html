    Modernization isn't just about replacing code or hardwareâ€”it's about
    collaboration, decision-making, and managing expectations. Technical
    challenges, while real, are often easier to solve compared to convincing
    teams to adapt, coordinating across silos, or aligning modernization goals
    with business priorities.
