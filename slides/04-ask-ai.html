      A design system is like a toolbox full of reusable building blocks for
      creating digital products. It includes things like buttons, colors, and
      rules for how things should look and feel. This helps designers and
      developers create apps or websites that are consistent, look good, and are
      easy to use. It saves time and keeps everything in line with the brand's
      style.
