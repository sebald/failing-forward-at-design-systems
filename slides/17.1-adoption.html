    <p>
      I've met with plenty of teams that have 90%-100% adoption of their design
      systems but still experience the same inefficiencies and inconsistencies
      in product and process that they had prior to adopting the design system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using adoption as the most important metric implies that the goal of a
      design system is to get used. It's not. The goal of a design system is to
      help its parent organization achieve its goals more efficiently and
      consistently with the least possible burden.
