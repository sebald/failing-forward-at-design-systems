    adoption is a lagging indicator of the goal, not the goal itself. Buying
    sneakers won't make you faster. And design system adoption doesn't indicate
    success. I've met with plenty of teams that have 90%-100% adoption of their
    design systems but still experience the same inefficiencies and
    inconsistencies in product and process that they had prior to adopting the
    design system.
